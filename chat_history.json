You want to create a state-of-the-art AI trip/travel planner app to impress recruiters and land an AI Engineer job. The app should be unique, easily explainable, and showcase your AI skills. Here's a plan for the first version:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **AI-Powered Itinerary Generation:** The core feature will be an AI that generates personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences (interests, budget, travel style, and job interview dates/locations). This will involve an input form and a display of the generated itinerary.\n-   **\"Impress the Recruiter\" Optimization:** A unique selling point (USP). The AI will consider factors that would impress a recruiter, such as suggesting locations relevant to AI research or companies, recommending activities that demonstrate problem-solving skills, or even suggesting networking opportunities at AI-related events in the area.\n-   **Interactive Map View:** Display the generated itinerary on an interactive map, highlighting key locations, travel routes, and points of interest.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Base color: White or a very light gray for a clean, modern look.\n    -   Primary text color: Dark gray or black for readability.\n    -   Accent colors: A vibrant blue or green to highlight interactive elements and key information.\n    -   Highlight shades: Lighter shades of the accent color for hover effects and selected items.\n-   **Typography:**\n    -   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" or \"Roboto\" for the main text.\n    -   Consider a slightly bolder font for headings and titles to create visual hierarchy.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-29T03:56:33.327484"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a state-of-the-art AI trip planner app that will impress recruiters!
